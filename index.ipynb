    "fa_convnav works with the fastai deep learning library, allowing users to explore convolutional neural network (CNN)  structure and composition as well as select modules and layers for further investigation using hooks and callbacks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* VGG\n",
    "* alexnet\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **'layers'** are the information processing units of the model, they can be single elements (e.g. `conv2d`, `batchnorm2d`, `maxpool`, `relu` etc) or for larger models with deeply nested sequences, a short sequence of elements wrapped in a container element. \n",
    "*   **'modules'** may be layers but also container elements, such as `nn.sequential`, which wrap a sequence of layers.\n",
    "*   **'container'** elements group sequences of CNN layers or modules togather into functional units.\n",
    "*   **'elements'** are all the elements that make up the CNN, both container and non-container,  layers and modules.\n",
    "*  **'divisions'** refer to the head (1) and body (0)  of a transfer learning model\n",
    "*  **'child containers'** are the first tier of nested modules. These usually match the modules returned with the fastai `model.named_children()` method. \n",
    "*   **'Blocks'** are the second tier of nested modules, usually repeating throughout the main bulk of the model and containing a fixed sequence of layers. Depending on the architecture, blocks may have a specific name such as `BasicBlock` or `_DenseBlock`.\n",
    "*  **'model'** refers to a pre-trained architecture with head and body divisions. \n",
    "*  **architecture** is an untrained neural network\n"
